## SYNOPSIS
The Stuttgart incarnation of the global phenomenon called hackerspace, makerspace, or fabrication lab, “[shackspace]” was founded early 2009. Since then its been steadily growing to 180 (and counting) members, making it Germany’s second largest by member count. It has so far sprouted a multitude of projects spanning and combining software development, electronics, art, personal fabrication, culinary explorations, home automation and aerospace applications. All the while being a community-driven past time of its contributors who come from backgrounds equally diverse as their projects.

### Why you should listen to him
Gregor has been one of the co-founders of shackspace, the Stuttgart hackerspace and is part of the team working on [Hackerspace Global Grid], the idea of a world-spanning network of affordable satellite communication ground stations. You will get a unique glimpse into what makes hackerspaces so special and precious to the community, how such spaces enable everyone to do unexpectedly great things, and how you yourself can help and make a contribution to citizen science, art, and do-it-yourself culture. Gregor has a passion for exploring alternative forms of practical technical education outside the realms of schools and universities and is not afraid to talk about it.
